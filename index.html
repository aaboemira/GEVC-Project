					About the Competition
					</h3>
					<p style="" class="about mt-2">
					The Global Electric Vehicle Challenge <span style="vertical-align: top; font-size:0.85rem;">&#174;</span> (GEVC) is the newest international university competition organized by Global EEE that raises the bar in terms of technology, innovation and engineering skills. Student teams will design, build, test and race high performance formula-style electric racecars.</p>
					<p> The competition spans approximately 17 months and is comprised of the following two stages:</p>
					<ul class="pl-4" style=" list-style: none; font-size:1.1em;">
					    <li "><table><tr><td>Stage 1:</td> <td>Design, analysis, simulation and virtual race</td></tr></table></li>
	                    <li "><table><tr><td style="width: 59.5px; vertical-align: top;">Stage 2:</td> <td>Vehicle construction, testing and racing on an exciting grand prix circuit</td></tr></table> </li>
	                    </ul>
	                    <p style="color: white;">
	                    Judging will be conducted for each stage separately and awards granted accordingly. Teams may participate in one of the two stages or both.</p>
					</p>
					<hr style="border-color:white;"> 
					<h3 style="color: white;">
					Rewarding Demonstrated Rigor
					</h3>
					<p>
					The technical submissions by the teams at the end of Stage 1 shall be reviewed and evaluated by designated judging committees comprised of GEVC officials, technical representatives from event partner organizations, and other subject matter experts in the following categories:
					</p>
					<ul class="pl-4 categories" style=" list-style: none;">
				    <li>- Aerodynamics</li>
				    <li>- Structural/Mechanical</li>
                    <li>- Electromechanical/Controls</li>
                    <li>- Electrical/Battery/BMS/Telemetry</li>
                    <li>- System Level and Strategy</li>
                    <li>- Vehicle Graphics Design</li>
                    <li>- Quality of report (neatness, accuracy, clarity, etc.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For each technical category, as applicable, the judges will evaluate the submissions based on the level of innovation/creativity, quality and depth of computer analysis and/or simulation, accuracy of analysis (assumptions), use of 3D printing (for example for packaging, scale modeling, test articles), and use of testing (wind tunnel or other aero testing, stiffness, structural, instrumentation).</p>
                    <p>The team with the highest overall score, the highest scoring team in each of the 7 categories, and the winner of the virtual race shall be recognized during the Stage 1 awards announcement/ceremony. </p>

						 Innovation not Big Budgets
					</h3>
					<p>
					The GEVC places great emphasis on technical innovation, rigorous use of design, analysis and simulation tools in addition to controlled testing where applicable.  Conversely, the GEVC discourages large budgets and aims to minimize any advantages gained through the purchase of high-cost components and materials.  These objectives are met in two ways:</p>
					<ul class="pl-3 our_list" style="list-style: none; list-style-position: outside; font-size:1.1em;">
						<li class="mb-2"> The competition is divided into the two stages whereby in stage 1 teams will be judged and rewarded for their technical innovation, rigorous use of design, analysis and simulation tools, and controlled testing; and</li>
						<li class="mb-2"> Certain components such as motors, controllers, batteries, wheels and tires will be specified in the regulations and must be used by all teams.</li>
					</ul>
					<p> Notwithstanding the aforementioned, there are vast opportunities for creative design and technical innovation in the chassis / steering / suspension design, aerodynamics, battery management, electromechanical systems and controls, strategy, telemetry, software engineering, materials science, among others.</p>
					<hr style="border-color:black;">
					<h3>
						Virtual Race
					</h3>
					<p>
						A virtual race platform has been developed in 2020 to enable teams to race in Global EEE competitions.  At the end of Stage 1 teams will have the opportunity to put their designs and strategy to the test in a head-to-head virtual race.  Stay tuned for more details!
